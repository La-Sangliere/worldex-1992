ECONOMY 
Overview: The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale light 
industry and tourism. Industry accounts for 53% of total employment, the 
service sector 45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 
2%. The sale of postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10 million 
annually. Low business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy 
incorporation rules have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter 
box companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, 
incorporated solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The 
economy is tied closely to that of Switzerland in a customs union, and 
incomes and living standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss 
groups.
