ECONOMY 
Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest 
component in the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been 
almost all in private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the 
republic traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been 
greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central 
planning and management. Tito had pushed the development of military 
industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share 
of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1992, the newly independent 
republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused 
production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery 
to multiply. The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit 
is in doubt. Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades 

 
and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups. 
These areas contain most of the industry. If a much smaller core Muslim 
state survives, it will share many Third World problems of poverty, 
technological backwardness, and dependence on historically soft foreign 
markets for its primary products. In these circumstances, other Muslim 
countries might offer assistance. 
 
GDP: $14 billion; real growth rate --37% (1991) 
 
Inflation rate (consumer prices): 80% per month (1991)
