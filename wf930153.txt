ECONOMY 
Overview: During the period 1988-91 booming exports helped Malaysia 
continue to recover from the severe 1985-86 recession. Real output grew by 
8.8% in 1989, 10% in 1990, and 8.6% in 1991, helped by vigorous growth in 
manufacturing output, further increases in foreign direct investment - 
particularly from Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home - 
and increased oil production. Malaysia has become the world's third-largest 
producer of semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan) and the world's 
largest exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation has remained low; 
unemployment has stood at 6% of the labor force; and the government has 
followed prudent fiscal/monetary policies. The country is not 
self-sufficient in food, and some of the rural population subsist at the 
poverty level. Malaysia's high export dependence leaves it vulnerable to a 
recession in the OECD countries or a fall in world commodity prices.
