ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country 
gained independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa 
production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, 
so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As 
a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious 
balance-of-payments problem. Production of less important crops, such as 
coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has also declined. The value of imports 
generally exceeds that of exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa 
production at the expense of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to 
import 90% of food needs. It also has to import all fuels and most 
manufactured goods.  Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its 
external debt, which amounts to roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable 
potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government 
has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also 
implemented a Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and 
reschedule external debt service payments in cooperation with the 
International Development Association and Western lenders.
