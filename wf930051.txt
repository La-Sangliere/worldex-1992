ECONOMY 
Overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural 
resource base, a 17-year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is 
service oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting 
for 65% of GDP during the period 1985-88. Although nearly 70% of the 
population lives in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the 
fishing sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The 
fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 
fishing represented only 3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade 
deficit, financed by remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic 
reforms launched by the new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed 
at developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to 
diversify the economy.
