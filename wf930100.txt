ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry,

imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In 
addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the islands. 
The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other 

 
crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), 
eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for 
local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, 
which comes mainly from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and 
rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment 
is especially high among the young.
