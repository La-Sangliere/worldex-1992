ECONOMY 
Overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors 
of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to 
high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the island 
has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in high-income

economy, have declined in their shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 
20% to GNP and manufacturing about 15%. Trade is mostly with the UK.
