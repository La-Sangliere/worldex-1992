ECONOMY 
Overview: The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which 
occupies most of the labor force and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. 
Manufacturing, which includes a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts 
for another quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in importance in recent 
years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted in 1978, and health 
concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry 
products are the main earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, 
except for a short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on 

 
South Africa, from which it receives 75% of its imports and to which it 
sends about half of its exports.
