ECONOMY 
Overview: The government of President Aylwin, which took power in 1990, 
has opted to retain the orthodox economic policies of Pinochet, although the 
share of spending for social welfare has risen slightly. In 1991 growth in 
GDP recovered to 5.5% (led by consumer spending) after only 2.1% growth in 
1990. The tight monetary policy of 1990 helped cut the rate of inflation 
from 27.3% in 1990 to 18.7% in 1991. Despite a 12% drop in copper prices, 
the trade surplus rose in 1991, and international reserves increased. 
Inflationary pressures are not expected to ease much in 1992, and economic 
growth is likely to approach 7%.
