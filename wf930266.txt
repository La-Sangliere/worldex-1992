ECONOMY 
Overview: In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources Zaire had a GDP 
per capita of only about $260, putting it among the desperately poor African 
nations. The country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1991, with 
copper and cobalt production down 20-30%, inflation near 8,000% in 1991 as 
compared with 100% in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank support suspended 
until the institution of agreed-on changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the 
economy, employs 75% of the population but generates under 25% of GDP. The 
main potential for economic development has been the extractive industries. 
Mining and mineral processing account for about one-third of GDP and 
three-quarters of total export earnings. Zaire is the world's largest 
producer of diamonds and cobalt.
