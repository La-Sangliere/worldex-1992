ECONOMY 
Overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues 
from the oil sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and 

 
about one-third of GDP. Since 1980, however, the sharp drop in oil prices 
and the resulting decline in export revenues have adversely affected 
economic development. In 1988 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at 
$5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response 
to changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient 
resource allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs, 
although the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the 
Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages. 
Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the 
government's ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure 
development projects. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in 
late 1990 improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current 
account surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing 
and construction sectors, which account for about 22% of GDP, have expanded 
from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals, 
iron, steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for about 5% of 
GDP, it employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor 
soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food 
requirements.
