ECONOMY 
Overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state 
ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and 
small-scale private trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic 
decline, Iran's GNP grew roughly 4% in FY90 and 10% in FY91. An oil windfall 
in 1990 combined with a substantial increase in imports contributed to 
Iran's recent economic growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of 
economic reforms to reduce government intervention (including subsidies) and 
has allocated substantial resources to development projects in the hope of 
stimulating the economy. Nevertheless, lower oil revenues in 1991 - oil 
accounts for more than 90% of export revenues and provides roughly 65% of 
the financing for the five-year economic development plan - and dramatic 

 
increases in external debt are threatening development plans and could 
prompt Iran to cut imports, thus limiting economic growth in the medium 
term.
