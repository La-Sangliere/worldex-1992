ECONOMY 
Overview: Civil war during 1990 destroyed much of Liberia's economy, 
especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate businessmen 
fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not 
return.  Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate 
favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic 
products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in 
scope. Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction 
and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring 
countries. In 1991, the political impasse between the interim government and 
the rebel leader Charles Taylor prevented restoration of normal economic 
life.
