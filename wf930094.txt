ECONOMY 
Overview: Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has 
been implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including 
moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily 
dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not 
spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending 
peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a 
democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and 
undercutting structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in 
1990. Much of the economic improvement in 1991 was caused by favorable 
weather (following a severe drought the previous year) that led to plentiful 
harvests in Ghana's agriculturally based economy.
