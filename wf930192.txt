ECONOMY 
Overview: GDP expanded by roughly 9.3% in 1991, following growth of 4.6% 
in 1990 and a 0.4% contraction in 1989. Delay in coming to terms with the 
international financial institutions on policies to implement structural 
reform in Panama generated uncertainty in the private sector and tempered 
the pace of business expansion in 1991. Public investment was limited as the 
administration kept the fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP. Unemployment and 
economic reform are the two major issues the government must face in 
1992-93.
