ECONOMY 
Overview: Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing, proximity 
to nearby oil- and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the potential 
for oil and gas deposits, but the Spratlys region is largely unexplored, and 
there are no reliable estimates of potential reserves; commercial 
exploitation has yet to be developed.
