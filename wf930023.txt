ECONOMY 
Overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia 
or Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian 

 
states in its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and 
low standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, 
oil, and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in 
decline for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might 
generate the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil 
unrest, marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between 
Muslim Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. 
Azerbaijan accounts for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the 
former Soviet Union. Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable 
because of civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about 
new economic arrangements, and the skittishness of foreign investors, 
Azerbaijan's economic performance was the best of all former Soviet 
republics in 1991 largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for 
industrial output.
