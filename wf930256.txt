ECONOMY 
Overview: Petroleum is the cornerstone of the economy and accounted for 
23% of GDP, 80% of central government revenues, and 80% of export earnings 
in 1991.  President PEREZ introduced an economic readjustment program when he 
assumed office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and price supports, a free 
market exchange rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy 
into confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. However, the economy 
recovered part way in 1990, and grew by 9.2% in 1991, led by the petroleum 
sector.
