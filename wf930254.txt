ECONOMY 
Overview: Although Uzbekistan accounted for only 3.4% of total Soviet 
output, it produced two-thirds of the USSR's cotton. Moscow's push for 
ever-increasing amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which 
caused extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the 
republic.  Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused 
extensive pollution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic 
has sought to encourage food production at the expense of cotton. The small 
industrial sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, 
mineral fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also 
has some important natural resources including gold (about 30% of Soviet 
production), uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged 
land reform but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.
