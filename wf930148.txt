ECONOMY 
Overview: The stable economy features moderate growth, low inflation, 
and negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but highly 
productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently 
dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified, particularly 
toward high-technology firms. During the past decade, growth in the 
financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. 
Services, especially banking, account for a growing proportion of the 
economy.  Luxembourg participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade 
and most financial matters and is also closely connected economically to the 
Netherlands.
