ECONOMY 
Overview: Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries 
in Africa. Its economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which accounts 
for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee 
generates 60% of export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily 
dependent on inputs from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale 
industry, but less than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is 
considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable 
agricultural weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, 
whereas drought and deteriorating internal security conditions prevented 
growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in the 
south, interfered with economic development and growth.
