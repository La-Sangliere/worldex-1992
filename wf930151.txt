ECONOMY 
Overview: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. 
Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, 
accounting for over 40% of GDP, employing about 80% of the labor force, and 
contributing to more than 70% of total export earnings. Industry is largely 
confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile 
manufacturing; in 1990 it accounted for only 16% of GDP and employed almost 
5% of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year 
development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 
1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After 
mid-1991, however, output dropped sharply because of protracted 
antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.
