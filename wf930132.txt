ECONOMY 

 
Overview: The second-largest in area of the 15 former Soviet republics, 
Kazakhstan has vast oil, coal, and agricultural resources. Kazakhstan is 
highly dependent on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for 
finished consumer and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with 
serious pollution problems, backward technology, and little experience in 
foreign markets. The government in 1991 pushed privatization of the economy 
at a faster pace than Russia's program. The ongoing transitional period - 
marked by sharp inflation in wages and prices, lower output, lost jobs, and 
disruption of time-honored channels of supply - has brought considerable 
social unrest. Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and managerial skills 
for a quick recovery of output. US firms have been enlisted to increase oil 
output but face formidable obstacles; for example, oil can now reach Western 
markets only through pipelines that run across independent (and sometimes 
unfriendly) former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic 
Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open.  The 6 million 
Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility 
of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the 
formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive, technologically 
advancing society.
