ECONOMY 
Overview: A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of 
economic development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few 
basic industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which 
accounts for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The 
ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the 
vagaries of the climate and the international coffee market. As part of its 
economic reform agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank 
support, Burundi is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability 
and attract foreign investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee 
companies were privatized via public auction in September 1991.
