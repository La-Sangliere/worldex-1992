ECONOMY 
Overview: The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the 
economy. Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export 
receipts, about 30% of government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 
1973-74 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming economy and helped 
to finance an ambitious program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas 
prices, combined with the mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized 
economy, has brought the nation to its most serious social and economic 
crisis since independence in 1988. The government has promised far-reaching 
reforms, including privatization of some public- sector companies, 
encouraging private-sector activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon 
exports, and proposing a major overhaul of the banking and financial 
systems, but to date it has made only limited progress.
