ECONOMY 
Overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been 
accompanied by bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic 
boundaries, and the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. The 
situation in Serbia and Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive 
political and military strife. This new state faces major economic problems. 
First, like the other former Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro 
depended on their sister republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy 
supplies, and manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral resources, 
and levels of technology among the six republics accentuated this 
interdependence, as did the Communist practice of concentrating much 
industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of many of 
the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost 
suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in the 
fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics. 
One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and Montenegro is 
the continuation in office of a Communist government that is primarily 
interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform. A further 
complication is the major economic sanctions by the leading industrial 
nations.
