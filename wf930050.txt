ECONOMY 
Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today 
closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic 
system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the impressive growth 
of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation 
from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 
1980s, Canada registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the 
OECD nations, averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, 
skilled labor force, and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic 
prospects. However, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- 
and French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the 
confederation; foreign investors are becoming edgy.
