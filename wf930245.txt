ECONOMY 
Overview: Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces 
enormous problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based 
central planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs, 
local government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This 
process requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property 
rights, and monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - 
is heavily weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the 
ex-USSR's gas and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former 
Soviet republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western 
region, where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya.
