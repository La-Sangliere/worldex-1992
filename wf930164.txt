the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder 
development. Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of 
revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the 
l990s. Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are 
major impediments to long-term growth.
