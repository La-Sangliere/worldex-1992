ECONOMY 
Overview: Latvia is in the process of reforming the centrally planned 
economy inherited from the former USSR into a market economy. Prices have 
been freed, and privatization of shops and farms has begun. Latvia lacks 
natural resources, aside from its arable land and small forests. Its most 
valuable economic asset is its work force, which is better educated and 
disciplined than in most of the former Soviet republics. Industrial 
production is highly diversified, with products ranging from agricultural 
machinery to consumer electronics. One conspicuous vulnerability: Latvia 
produces only 10% of its electric power needs. Latvia in the near term must 
retain key commercial ties to Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine while moving in 
the long run toward joint ventures, technological support, and trade ties to 
the West. Because of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms, Latvians 
enjoy a diet that is higher in meat, vegetables, and dairy products and 
lower in grain and potatoes than diets in the 12 non-Baltic republics of the 
USSR. Good relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic 
Russians (34% of the population) and native Latvians.
