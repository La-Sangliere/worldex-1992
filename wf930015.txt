ARCTIC OCEAN 

 
GEOGRAPHY 
Total area: 14,056,000 km2 
 
Land area: 14,056,000 km2; includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort 
Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson 
Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, and other tributary water bodies 
 
Comparative area: slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US; 
smallest of the world's four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, 
and Indian Ocean) 
 
Coastline: 45,389 km 
 
Disputes: some maritime disputes (see littoral states) 
 
Climate: persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature 
ranges; winters characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable 
weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized by continuous 
daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow 
 
Terrain: central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack 
that averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be 
three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, 
but nearly straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands (Russia) to 
Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the ice pack is surrounded 
by open seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the 
winter and extends to the encircling land masses; the ocean floor is about 
50% continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a 
central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera, 
Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the 
Fram Basin 
 
Natural resources: sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, 
polymetallic nodules, oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals, 
whales) 
 
Environment: endangered marine species include walruses and whales; ice 
islands occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island; icebergs 
calved from glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada; 
maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the 
frozen ocean and lasts about 10 months; permafrost in islands; virtually 
icelocked from October to June; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to 
recover from disruptions or damage 
 
Note: major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to 
the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); ships subject to superstructure 
icing from October to May; strategic location between North America and 
Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western 
Russia, floating research stations operated by the US and Russia 
 
ECONOMY 
Overview: Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural 
resources, including crude oil, natural gas, fish, and seals. 
 
COMMUNICATIONS 
Ports: Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay (US) 
 
Telecommunications: no submarine cables 
 
Note: sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the 

 
Northwest Passage (North America) and Northern Sea Route (Asia) are 
important seasonal waterways
