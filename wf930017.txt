ECONOMY 
Overview: Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had 
built up textile, machine-building, and other industries and had become a 
key supplier to sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies 
of raw materials and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies 
enter the republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The 
economy has been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control 
of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated 
enclave within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to 
outright warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports 
on the Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to 
beleagured Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 
destroyed about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of 
which has not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources 
has been disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the 
central USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable 
by the earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 
40% of Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced 
one-quarter of the output of elevators in the former USSR.  Armenia has some 
deposits of nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) 
that are largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects 
seem particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high 
dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of 
transformation.
