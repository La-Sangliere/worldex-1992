ECONOMY 
Overview: Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy began to emerge 
from a lengthy depression in 1990 and 1991. The economy fell sharply through 
most of the 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector 
accounts for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of GDP. The 
government, in response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of 
austerity measures that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. 
The economy showed signs of recovery in 1990, however, helped along by 
rising oil prices. Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force and 
produces about 3% of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to 
absorb the large numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks 
to diversify its export base.
