ISRAEL 
(also see separate Gaza Strip and West Bank entries): *** No entry for 
this item *** 
 
Note: The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not 
included in the data below. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and 
reaffirmed by President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final 
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their 
neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated 
among the concerned parties. The Camp David Accords further specify that 
these negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. 
Pending the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final 
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined (see West 
Bank and Gaza Strip entries). On 25 April 1982 Israel relinquished control 
of the Sinai to Egypt. Statistics for the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are 
included in the Syria entry.

ECONOMY 
Overview: Israel has a market economy with substantial government 
participation. It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, 
and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has 
intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 
20 years.  Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and 
services most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and 
agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel 
usually posts balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large 
transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the 
government's $17 billion external debt is owed to the United States, which 
is its major source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign 
exchange, Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in international 
markets, such as medical scanning equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 
August 1990 dealt a blow to Israel's economy. Higher world oil prices added 

 
an estimated $300 million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep 
annual inflation at 18%. Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian 
uprising (intifadah) have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism - a key 
foreign exchange earner - to the lowest level since the 1973 Arab-Israeli 
war. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 
330,000 during the period 1990-91, will increase unemployment, intensify 
housing problems, widen the government budget deficit, and fuel inflation.
