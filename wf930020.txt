ATLANTIC OCEAN 
GEOGRAPHY 
Total area: 82,217,000 km2 
 
Land area: 82,217,000 km2; includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean 
Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, 
Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, Weddell Sea, and other 
tributary water bodies 
 
Comparative area: slightly less than nine times the size of the US; 
second-largest of the world's four oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but 
larger than Indian Ocean or Arctic Ocean) 
 
Coastline: 111,866 km 
 
Disputes: some maritime disputes (see littoral states) 
 
Climate: tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa 
near Cape Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can 
occur from May to December, but are most frequent from August to November 
 
Terrain: surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark 
Strait, and Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre 
(broad, circular system of currents) in the north Atlantic, counterclockwise 

 
warm water gyre in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the 
Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic 
basin; maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench 
 
Natural resources: oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and 
whales), sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, 
precious stones 
 
Environment: endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea 
lions, turtles, and whales; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, 
southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf 
of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial 
waste and municipal sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and 
Mediterranean Sea; icebergs common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the 
northwestern Atlantic from February to August and have been spotted as far 
south as Bermuda and the Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica occur in 
the extreme southern Atlantic 
 
Note: ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north Atlantic 
from October to May and extreme south Atlantic from May to October; 
persistent fog can be a hazard to shipping from May to September; major 
choke points include the Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar, access to the 
Panama and Suez Canals; strategic straits include the Dover Strait, Straits 
of Florida, Mona Passage, The Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; north 
Atlantic shipping lanes subject to icebergs from February to August; the 
Equator divides the Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South 
Atlantic Ocean 
 
ECONOMY 
Overview: Economic activity is limited to exploitation of natural 
resources, especially fish, dredging aragonite sands (The Bahamas), and 
crude oil and natural gas production (Caribbean Sea and North Sea).
