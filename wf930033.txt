ECONOMY 
Overview: Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world 
because of limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure. 
Agriculture accounts for about 35% of GDP, employs about 60% of the labor 
force, and generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The 
industrial sector contributes only about 15% to GDP and employs 2% of the 
work force. Low prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings 
from Benin's major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.
