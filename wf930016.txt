ECONOMY 
Overview: Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly 
literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a 
diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of 
mismanagement and statist policies, the economy has encountered major 
problems in recent years, leading to escalating inflation and a recession 
during 1988-90.  Since 1978, Argentina's external debt has nearly doubled to 
$58 billion, creating severe debt servicing difficulties and hurting the 
country's creditworthiness with international lenders. Elected in 1989, 
President Menem has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring 
program that shows signs of reversing Argentina's economic decline and 
putting it on a path of stable, sustainable growth.
