ECONOMY 
Overview: Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is basically 
capitalistic, but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and 
comparatively even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent 
on the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In 
the absence of other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to 
changing world fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from 
climbing fish prices in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably 
will be reversed by tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of 
an aluminum smelting plant. The conservative government's economic 
priorities include reducing the budget and current account deficits, 
containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, 
diversifying the economy, and tying the krona to the EC's European currency 
unit in 1993. The fishing industries - notably the shrimp industry - are 
experiencing a series of bankruptcies and mergers. Inflation has continued 
to drop sharply from 20% in 1989 to about 7.5% in 1991 and possibly 3% in 
1992, while unemployment is expected to increase to 2.5%. GDP is expected to 
contract by nearly 4% in 1992.
