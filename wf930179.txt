ECONOMY 
Overview: Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian 
economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to an open free market 
economy that can compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that 
dynamic growth would boost real incomes, reduce inflationary pressures, and 
permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: 
inflation is down from double-digit levels, but growth has been sluggish and 
unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10% since May 
1991. In 1988, GDP fell by 1%, in 1989 grew by a moderate 2.4%, and was flat 
in 1990-91.
